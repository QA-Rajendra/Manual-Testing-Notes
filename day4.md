## 

| Feature | QA ✅ | QC 🛠️ | QE 🤖 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Focus | Process-oriented | Product-oriented | Build quality into product |
| Goal | Prevent defects | Detect defects | Automation + continuous quality |
| Role | Set rules & monitor | Execute tests & report bugs | Develop test frameworks & automation |
| SDLC Involvement | Entire cycle 🔄 | Testing phase only 🧪 | Entire cycle with automation ⚙️ |

## 2️⃣ Testing Methodologies

## 

| Type | Concept | Focus | Knowledge | Who | Emoji Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| White Box 🧑‍💻 | Transparent box | Internal code, logic, paths | Programming needed | Developers | Unit test add(2,3)=5 |
| Black Box 👤 | Opaque box | Functionality & requirements | No code needed | Testers / Users | Login page, shopping cart |
| Grey Box 🔍 | Semi-transparent box | Functionality + internal data | Some tech knowledge (DB/API) | Testers/Dev | Form submission → DB/API check |

**Quick Tip:**

*   White Box = 🔍 Look inside the code
    
*   Black Box = 👀 Look only at what user sees
    
*   Grey Box = 👁️ Peek inside + user view
