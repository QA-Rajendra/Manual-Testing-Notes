## 1️⃣ What is Software?

**Definition:**  
A software is a collection of computer programs designed to perform specific tasks.

**Types of Software:**

| Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System Software | Controls and manages hardware & basic system operations | Windows, Linux, device drivers |
| Programming Software | Helps developers write, test, and debug code | Compilers, interpreters, debuggers |
| Application Software | Used by end-users to perform daily tasks | MS Word, Chrome, WhatsApp, YouTube |

## 2️⃣ What is Software Testing?

**Definition:**  
Software Testing checks if the software:

*   Works correctly
    
*   Is bug-free
    
*   Meets customer requirements
    

**Simple Highlights:**

1.  Part of SDLC. ✅
    
2.  Detects defects before reaching customers. ✅
    
3.  Goal: Deliver a **quality product**. ✅
    

**Why Testing is Needed:**

| Reason | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Ensure bug-free software | Defects affect user experience and trust |
| Meet customer requirements | Software should behave as expected |
| Meet user expectations | Features should work smoothly |
| Avoid costly fixes | Bugs found later are expensive to fix |

**Real-life Example:**  
Buying a phone where the camera doesn’t work → Defect. Testing ensures this doesn’t happen before launch.

## 3️⃣ Core Characteristics of High-Quality Software

A software is **high quality** if it is:  
✅ Bug-free  
✅ Delivered on time  
✅ Within budget  
✅ Meets customer expectations  
✅ Maintainable (easy to fix/update)

## 4️⃣ The 3 P’s of Software Companies

**People → Process → Product**

| P | Meaning | Importance in Testing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| People | Human resources (Developers, Testers, BAs, Managers, Clients) | Skilled testers find bugs early |
| Process | Step-by-step methods to develop & deliver software | Good processes reduce defects |
| Product | Final software delivered | Should be high-quality & user-friendly |

**Relation:**  
People **follow a process** to build a **product**.

* * *

## 5️⃣ Project vs Product

**Project:**

*   Custom software for a specific client
    
*   Example: ICICI Bank software → Not reusable for SBI
    

**Product:**

*   Software for many users based on market needs
    
*   Example: WhatsApp, MS Word, Google Chrome
    

**Analogy:**

*   Project = Tailor-made dress
    
*   Product = Ready-made dress
    

**Company Types:**

1.  **Product-Based** → Build own products (Google, Microsoft)
    
2.  **Service-Based** → Build for clients (TCS, Infosys)
    

* * *

## 6️⃣ Error, Bug/Defect, and Failure

| Term | Definition | Stage | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Error | Human mistake in coding, design, or requirement analysis | Development | a = b - c instead of a = b + c |
| Bug / Defect | Deviation between expected & actual output | Testing | Expected: Total = 100, Actual: Total = 50 |
| Failure | Defect reaches the user → application fails | Production | User clicks “Pay Now” → app crashes |

**Flow:**  
**ERROR → DEFECT → FAILURE**

* * *

## 7️⃣ Why Software Has Bugs

1.  **Miscommunication** → Misunderstood requirements  
    Example: “Download PDF” vs “Save as PDF”
    
2.  **Software Complexity** → More modules = higher chance of mistakes
    
3.  **Programming Errors** → Logic or syntax mistakes  
    Example: Misplaced semicolon breaks tax calculation
    
4.  **Changing Requirements (Scope Creep)** → Late changes break tested code
    
5.  **Lack of Skilled Testers** → Edge cases or invalid inputs not tested
    

**Other Common Reasons:**

*   **Time Pressure** → Skipped test cases, rushed code
    
*   **Incomplete Unit Testing** → Core logic not tested
    
*   **No Code Reviews** → Mistakes remain unchecked
    
*   **Poor Documentation** → Misunderstood functionality
    
*   **Third-party Integration Issues** → APIs/plugins fail

| Software | Programs designed to perform tasks | विशिष्ट कामांसाठी तयार केलेली प्रोग्राम्स |
| Types of Software | System, Programming, Application | सिस्टीम, प्रोग्रामिंग, अॅप्लिकेशन |
| Software Testing | Checks if software works correctly, bug-free, meets requirements | सॉफ्टवेअर बग-मुक्त आहे का, योग्य काम करते का, ग्राहकाच्या गरजा पूर्ण होतात का हे तपासणे |
| Purpose of Testing | Ensure quality, meet customer needs, avoid costly fixes | गुणवत्ता सुनिश्चित करणे, ग्राहकाची अपेक्षा पूर्ण करणे, नंतरच्या महागड्या दुरुस्त्या टाळणे |
| Software Quality | Bug-free, on-time, within budget, maintainable | बग-मुक्त, वेळेवर, बजेटमध्ये, सोप्या दुरुस्तीयोग्य |
| 3 P’s | People, Process, Product → build quality software | लोक, प्रक्रिया, उत्पादन → उच्च गुणवत्ता सॉफ्टवेअर तयार करणे |
| Project vs Product | Project = custom for one client, Product = ready-made for many | प्रोजेक्ट = एका क्लायंटसाठी खास, प्रॉडक्ट = सर्वांसाठी तयार केलेले |
| Error / Bug / Failure | Error → Bug → Failure | त्रुटी → बग → अपयश |
| Why Bugs Happen | Miscommunication, complexity, programming mistakes, scope creep, lack of skilled testers | गैरसमज, जटिलता, प्रोग्रामिंग चुका, मागण्या बदलणे, अनुभवाचा अभाव |
