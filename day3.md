*   ✅ **High Quality:** Continuous verification & validation
    

* * *

### Core Principle

## 

*   🔹 **Verification (Left Arm):** _Are we building the product right?_
    
*   🔹 **Validation (Right Arm):** _Are we building the right product?_
    
*   🔗 **Traceability:** Every dev phase ↔ corresponding test phase

V-Model: Verification, Validation & Testing Techniques

### Introduction

## 

The **V-Model** is an SDLC model designed to improve software quality by integrating **testing activities throughout development**, rather than leaving them until the end, as in traditional models like Waterfall or Spiral.

**Problems in Traditional SDLCs:**

1.  **Delayed Testing:** Testing only happens after development, making defects expensive to fix.
    
2.  **Rigidity:** Waterfall is sequential, Spiral allows some flexibility, but major mid-project changes are hard to manage.
    

* * *

### Key Principle of the V-Model

## 

*   **Integrated Testing:** Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase.
    
*   **Early Defect Detection:** Testing starts from the requirement phase, reducing cost and effort for fixes.
    
*   **Improved Product Quality:** Continuous verification and validation throughout SDLC.
    

* * *

### V-Model Structure

## 

*   **Left Arm (Verification):** Development phases, moving downward.
    
*   **Right Arm (Validation):** Testing phases, moving upward, corresponding to left-arm phases.
    

* * *

## Left Arm – Verification & Static Testing

### Development Phases

## 

1.  **Requirement Analysis**
    
    *   **BRS (Business Requirement Specification):** High-level user needs.
        
    *   **SRS (Software Requirement Specification):** Detailed software requirements.
        
    *   Created by **Product Managers/Business Analysts**.
        
2.  **Design Phase**
    
    *   **HLD (High-Level Design):** Overall system structure, modules, database, interfaces.
        
    *   **LLD (Low-Level Design):** Detailed module logic, algorithms, data structures.
        
3.  **Implementation/Coding**
    
    *   Actual coding based on HLD and LLD.
        

### Verification

## 

*   **Definition:** Ensuring each development phase meets requirements and standards.
    
*   **Focus:** Documents, designs, specifications (pre-code verification).
    
*   **Question Asked:** _“Are we building the product right?”_
    

### Static Testing

## 

*   Testing **without running the software**.
    
*   **Focus:** Correctness and completeness of documents.
    
*   **Techniques:**
    
    1.  **Reviews:** Detailed examination of documents.
        
    2.  **Walkthroughs:** Informal explanation to a team for feedback.
        
    3.  **Inspections:** Formal, structured reviews with roles like moderator, reader, recorder.

## Right Arm – Validation & Dynamic Testing

### Validation

## 

*   **Definition:** Ensuring the built software meets user needs.
    
*   **Question Asked:** _“Are we building the right product?”_
    
*   **Focus:** Actual executable software.
    

### Dynamic Testing

## 

*   Testing **by executing the software**.
    
*   **Techniques:**
    
    1.  **Unit Testing (LLD → Unit Modules)**
        
        *   Test individual modules. Done by developers.
            
        *   Example: Testing the 'add' function in a calculator.
            
    2.  **Integration Testing (HLD → Module Interaction)**
        
        *   Test communication between integrated modules.
            
        *   Example: Sending an email appears in 'Sent Folder'.
            
    3.  **System Testing (SRS → Whole System)**
        
        *   Test full system against requirements. Done by testers.
            
    4.  **User Acceptance Testing (BRS → End-User)**
        
        *   End-users test the software in real environment.

*   Each development phase is **mapped directly to a testing phase**:
    
    *   **BRS → UAT**
        
    *   **SRS → System Testing**
        
    *   **HLD → Integration Testing**

### Verification vs. Validation

## 

| Feature | Verification | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Question | Are we building the product right? | Are we building the right product? |
| Focus | Process, methodology, adherence to specs | Software functionality, alignment with user needs |
| Stage | Pre-execution (planning, design) | Post-execution (actual software) |
| Techniques | Reviews, Walkthroughs, Inspections | Unit, Integration, System, UAT Testing |

* * *

### Static vs. Dynamic Testing

## 

| Feature | Static Testing | Dynamic Testing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Approach | Analyze documents/code without execution | Execute software and observe behavior |
| Tested | Documents (BRS, SRS, HLD, LLD), design, code | Executable software |
| Purpose | Detect defects early in documentation/design | Verify functionality and performance |
| Techniques | Reviews, Walkthroughs, Inspections | Unit, Integration, System, UAT |
