#### 1️⃣ What is SDLC?

#### 

**Answer:**

*   **Definition:** SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured process for **designing, developing, and maintaining software**.
    
*   **Purpose:** Ensures software is **high-quality, error-free, and meets client requirements**.
    
*   **Memory Tip:** Think of SDLC as a **roadmap for software** — like planning a journey before starting. 🛣️
    
*   **Example:** Building WhatsApp follows SDLC: requirements → design → coding → testing → release → maintenance.
    

* * *

#### 2️⃣ What are the phases of SDLC?

#### 

**Answer:** SDLC has **6 main phases**:

1.  **Requirement Gathering & Analysis:** Understand client needs and document them. 📝
    
2.  **Design:** Plan software architecture, database, and UI/UX. 🏗️
    
3.  **Implementation / Coding:** Developers write code according to design. 💻
    
4.  **Testing:** Check for bugs, errors, and ensure requirements are met. 🐞
    
5.  **Deployment:** Release software to users. 🚀
    
6.  **Maintenance:** Fix bugs, update software post-launch. 🔧
